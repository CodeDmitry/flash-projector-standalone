# Flash-Projector-Standalone
This archive contains the last available flash projector before Adobe took it down. The flash projector is used for playing Adobe Flash .swf files without installation.

See https://web.archive.org/web/20150227183255/http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html
or https://archive.org/details/standaloneflashplayers for alternative versions.

<b>IMPORTANT</b>: While most of the FUD campaigning done by Adobe, Apple, Microsoft, and others concerning Flash files was unjustified, .swf files should still be treated like .exe files, and inspected carefully with ffdec for suspicious scripts if obtained from untrusted sources. Please use ffdec tool obtained from https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler on swf files to inspect their scripts before running them. My suggestion is to extract the scripts into a directory, search for ".as" files, and sort them by size ascending. Inspect the biggest files first as they are most likely to contain complex code. Briefly scan the other files with varying sizes as well.

Included is shii-song_flash.swf for testing the projector.

The archived files are for Linux, the executables are for Windows, see other archives/links above for the mac version.
